Error 1 : Apostrophe(single quotes) Issue in Inserting data In Mysql ?

mysql_real_escape_string() can be used to by pass this error but it is depricated method.

The reason mysql forbit the Apostrophe from entering raw into data insert it to defend SQL Injection Attack.

This problem can be solved using addslashes() or addcslashes() functions.

Since the input string can containe many special characters, MySQL will assume them as threat and show error.
To get around this error, I use addslashes() function. That function put backslashes behind every predefined 
characters such as single quote ('), double quote ("), backslash (\), and NULL.

We can also use addcslashes() function instead of addslashes(), 
if we wish to custom specify which we want to add backslash after them.

See -> https://www.w3schools.com/php/func_string_addcslashes.asp

There is another possibility. 
I created the database with utf8mb4_unicode_ci 
instead of utf8mb4_general_ci.

I have to check when I create a database with utf8mb4_general_ci.
We will see if there will be an error or not in CRUD process concerning with special characters input.

Two string methods
behavior of MySQL upon special characters in string data
Many ways to make query string but this one is simplest "INSERT INTO tablename (column1,column2) VALUES ('value1','value2')"
